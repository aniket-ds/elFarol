Object Oriented Programming Example

## How to use
* Install Python >= 3.5 on your machine
```bash
python elFarol.py
```


## Contents
* __Farol Module__: A folder containing Python code for all the applicable classes included in the simulation; see *Object Based Considerations* below
* __Farol_logfile.txt__: An example log file if the log option is shown
* __Presentation_Helper.ipynb__: A brief Jupyter notebook introducing the problem with a visual
* __README.md__: What you are reading right now :)
* __diagram.jpg__: Picture used in `Presentation_Helper.ipynb`
* __elFarol.py__: Main script for running El Farol simulation


## Background
* Simulations of the El Farol problem
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Farol_Bar_problem

The overall goal of this project would be to run simulations around the El Farol problem which tries to answer the question "should I go to the bar tonight?" The underlying premises are that there is a threshold value of people at the bar that, above the threshold
the bar is too crowded and you would have had more fun at home, and below the threshold
you would have had more fun at the bar. All of the decision making "agents" must
make a decision to go out or stay in at the same time, and will adjust their strategies
to try to maximize their happiness. Each agent will have a slightly different willingness
to change their strategy, but each will have the same memory length (unless it 
looks like I need more lines of code, then maybe we look at agents of different 
memory lengths).

This is a fundamental problem in complexity theory, and shows how even very random
situations can lead to emergent behavior.
